2/6/25: Worked on Auth routes like sign up and login. Just hashed some passwords, but still don't know how to get type safe data back from the DB.
Next let's create a user and then log in with them. Then we can maybe do some JWT stuff.

2/8/25: Created jwt token stuff. Hashing and verifying passwords, but I have not tested it yet. Started looking into templating engines. I think I will use handlebars. I also need to figure out how to get type safe data back from the DB.
Next let's create some html templates and get some pages up. (Tailwind, HTMX, Handlebars) Maybe we will separate the handlers and the DAO layer as well so we can make testing easier.

2/9/25: Set up handlebars, but no templates yet. Using the data module as the logic place. Set up static file serving as well.
Next let's render some html templates and serve them up. Try to get a whole auth cycle in.

2/10/25: Got some htmx rendered and flowbite kinda set up. But now we're serving HTML.
Next let's get that whole auth cycle in and fix the flowbite stuff that's missing like the js stuff and dark mode toggles.
